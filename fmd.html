     </p>

    <p>
      To use FavMe, allow FavMe to access websites from time to time through your device.
    </p>
    <p>
      FavMe offers full access to the application in exchange for a certain number of user network connections and device resources. For this FavMe agreement to work properly, access to a limited amount of your personal information is required.
    </p>

      By confirming the consent of the data transfer, you confirm your consent to the Privacy Policy (below) of the service. 
      You can opt out of the services provided by the service at any time by uninstalling this application.
    </p>

    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <p>
      By using FavMe, the app and its services may use your free device resources to collect publicly available information from the web, only when the device is idle (i.e. CPU utilization is sufficiently low so that FavMe operation will not impact user experience or performance of other running applications).
    </p>

    <h3>Restrictions</h3>
    <p>
      You agree not to, and you will not permit others to license, sell, rent, lease, assign, distribute, transmit, host, outsource, disclose or otherwise commercially exploit the app or make it available to any third party.
    </p>

    <h3>Modifications</h3>
    <p>
      FavMe reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the app or any service to which it connects, with or without notice and without liability to you.
    </p>

    <h3>Term and Termination</h3>
    <p>
      This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated by you, FavMe or its partners. 
      FavMe may, in its sole discretion, at any time and for any or no reason, suspend or terminate this Agreement with or without prior notice. This Agreement will terminate immediately, without prior notice from FavMe or its partners, in the event that you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement. 
      You may also terminate this Agreement by deleting this application and all copies thereof from your mobile device or from your desktop.
    </p>

    <h3>Severability</h3>
    <p>
      If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
    </p>

    <h3>Amendments to this Agreement</h3>
    <p>
      FavMe reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any time.
    </p>

    <h3>Security and Confidentiality</h3>
    <p>
      We use industry-standard security tools and measures, as well as internal procedures and strict guidelines to prevent information misuse and data leakage. Our employees and contractors access the information on a need-to-know basis and subject to confidentiality obligations.

We use measures and procedures that substantially reduce the risks of data misuse, but we cannot guarantee that our systems will be absolutely safe. If you become aware of any potential data breach or security vulnerability, you are requested to contact us immediately. We will use all measures to investigate the incident, including preventive measures, as required.

Since we operate globally, it may be required to transfer your Personal Information to other countries worldwide. In these instances, we will take steps to ensure that a similar level of protection is given to your Personal Information through adequate legal mechanisms, in accordance with the GDPR.

    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <h3>FavMe privacy in simple terms</h3>
    <p>
      Let's be very clear: We don't know any personal information about you, who you are, or what you do online.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>We don't know your name, your email, what web pages you visit, or what apps you use.
      </li>
      <li>We don't read identifiers that already exist on your device (for example: Apple's IDFA)
      </li>
      <li>We don't leave any cookies or other identifiers on your device.
      </li>
      <li>We don't know or track what you do on a specific app, or across several apps.
      </li>
      <li>Since we don't have any data about you, we of course have nothing to share with 3rd parties.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In other words, to us all users are anonymous and indistinguishable. We just don't need to know any of your personal information, and we don't track you in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one thing we know, and that is your IP address. We respect all applicable data privacy regulations when it comes to it. BTW, you know who else knows your IP address? Any website you visit, and any app you use - they all know your IP address too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though we know your IP, we do not use it for FavMe's or its partners ongoing business operations. In fact, the reason we collect it is to comply with GDPR (e.g. record the fact you gave your consent) and to comply with other legal requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarize - search engines, social networks and advertising networks all need some sort of information about you in order to decide which ads to display to you. Lumiapps's SDK is totally different. It does not display ads, does not collect any of your personal information, and does not track you in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope this helps clarify what we know about you. Now, feel free to read the full policy:
    </p>

    <h3>Our official privacy policy</h3>

      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Legal basis for processing</h3>
